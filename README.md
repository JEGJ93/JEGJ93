Hello ðŸ‘‹

Hi, i'm Julio! I'm a full-stack web developer who is a true believer that technology is going to help us become an advanced civilization. 

I believe that technology is the future of our world, which is why I am currently becoming an Engineer. We need more people in this world who are interested in becoming a part of the STEM field. I want to help create things that are beneficial to the advancement of our societies. That is why I am currently challenging myself harder than I ever have before to gain the knowledge to maybe one day help create something beneficial to us all. In my free time, I enjoy watching MMA and playing video games.

My technical skills include JavaScript and Python fundamentals. I have learned how to work with react components for frontend development and node.js / postman for backend development. I am also familiar with HTML and CSS in designing web pages.
